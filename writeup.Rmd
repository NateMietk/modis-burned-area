## Abstract

## Introduction

## Methods

### Study Area

The study area was the coterminous United States (CUS). We chose this study area because of the availability of other fire datasets like MTBS [@Eidenshink2007] which we were able to use to gauge accuracy. 

### Data Acquisition and Processing

We used the modis Collection 6 MCD64 burned area product [@Giglio2009, available at ftp://fuoco.geog.umd.edu/MCD64A1/C6/]. These data come with 5 layers: burn date, first day, last day, qaqc, and error, all in julian day. We wrote a script to download each tile that overlaps with a shapefile (in this case, the coterminous U.S.) for the entire time series available. Then, it extracts the burn date layer, and aggregates the tiles for each month, resulting in a layer for the entire CUS for each month. We then aggregated to the year by merging each yearly series together, taking the maximum julian day for each pixel. 

This resulting layer assumes a minimal effect of intrayear reburns, and so we calculated intrayear reburns. We converted each monthly grid to binary (1 for burned, 0 for unburned), summed each monthly pixel and calculated the percentage of intrayear reburns per tile. We found an occurrence of intrayear of 1% or less for the vast majority of the CUS, with the exception of the tile that contains Florida, which averaged close to 5% intrayear reburns.

Then, we wrote a python script that uses a moving window to aggregate burned pixels into distinct events (probably want a figure here, maybe a conceptual flowchart for this whole thing). This script takes as input a spatial variable, representing the number of pixels, and a temporal variable representing the julian day. It then aggregates by assigning each burned pixel an identification number. 

We wanted to find which combination of spatial and temporal variables outputs events that have the closest resemblence to what is commonly thought of as a fire event, so we used MTBS fire perimeters [@Eidenshink2007] as a ground truth, of sorts. MTBS is a dataset of fire occurrence from 1984-2015 derived from Landsat
