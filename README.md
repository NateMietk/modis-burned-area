## FIRED: Fire event delineation.

This is a project to aggregate burned area grids into fire events. It is a collaboration between people who program mostly in R and people who code mostly in python. The main algorithm is in python, so everything that was originally done in R to create the final product has been (or will be) translated to python. Other things, like statistical analysis and sensitivity anlyses that were conducted will remain in R. The Dockerfile exists to set up a python environment to facilitate running the event delineation algorithm.
